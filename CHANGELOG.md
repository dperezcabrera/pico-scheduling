# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Dependency floors raised to what the test suite proves: `pico-ioc >= 2.3.3` (was 2.2.0; below 2.3.0 the settings prefix fails to resolve) and `apscheduler >= 3.10.2` (was 3.10, which imports the removed `pkg_resources`). A new CI job runs the suite with every declared floor pinned, so a floor that installs but does not work can no longer ship.

### Added
- `__all__` declares the public API and `tests/test_exports.py` pins it, per the ecosystem stability policy (ADR-014 in pico-ioc).

### Documentation
- `docs/architecture.md` links the ADR-014 stability and deprecation policy.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- `@scheduled(every=seconds)` and `@scheduled(cron="...")` marker decorator for component methods (sync and async).
- `SchedulerRegistrar`: discovers scheduled methods at container startup, runs them on a `BackgroundScheduler`, stops on container shutdown.
- `scheduling.enabled` setting (zero-config, defaults to on).
- Auto-discovery via the `pico_boot.modules` entry point.
